Description:
    
    This project works with unsupervised machine learning. We use the KMeans technique to cluster the crypto currencies by their performance. This allows us to visualize their preformance and create a portfolio. By doing this we can find trends and outliers. 

Technologies:

This project uses python 3.7 with the following packages:

- [pandas](Data analysis in Python with pandas/toc.txt) - For data analysis and manipulation.

- [pathlib] - For interacting with file systems easier.

- [hvplot]- For making interactive plots/charts.

- [sklearn.cluster import KMeans] - used to identify clusters of data objects in a dataset.

- [sklearn.decomposition import PCA] - used to decompose a multivariate dataset in a set of successive orthogonal components that explain a maximum amount of the variance. 

- [sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler] - Standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.

Installation Guide:
Before running the application first install the following dependencies:
- import pandas as pd
- import hvplot.pandas
- from pathlib import Path
- from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
- from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
- from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

Usage:
    This project allows us

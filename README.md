Proptech application of technology in real-estate:


Technologies:

This project uses python 3.7 with the following packages:

- [pandas](Data analysis in Python with pandas/toc.txt) - For data analysis and manipulation.

- [pathlib] - For interacting with file systems easier.

- [hvplot]- For making interactive plots/charts.

- [sklearn.cluster import KMeans] - 

- [sklearn.decomposition import PCA] - 

- [sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler] - 

Installation Guide:
Before running the application first install the following dependencies:
- import pandas as pd
import hvplot.pandas
from pathlib import Path
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

Usage:
Using Proptech data visualization skills. This allows us to determine what are the best real estate investment options in the area. Using this application we can determine what are the best areas to buy for rental properties.
